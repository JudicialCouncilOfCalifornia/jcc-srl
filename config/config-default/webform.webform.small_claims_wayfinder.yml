        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Before you continue, there are a few things you may wish to consider before going to small claims.</p>
        
        <p>First, as a plaintiff (the person bringing the lawsuit), you do not have a right to appeal a decision made in small claims court, although the other side, the defendant, does.</p>
        
        <p>Second, the ability to gather evidence from the other side and third parties (a process called "discovery") is very limited in small claims court. So, if you need to gather evidence from other sources, you may wish to gather it before filing your case or consider using a superior court case which allows for the extensive discovery of evidence.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, the small claims court generally can only deal with disputes with money damages, and can, for the most part, only order money to be paid as a judgment. If you require the court to order the other side to do something (other than pay you money), small claims might not be a good option.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>This page is triggered by an individual or an individual suing as a sole proprietorship business who has not filed 2 cases over $2,500 in a calendar year, and is suing for $10,000 or less.</p>
