        <p class="jcc-lead">Looking at the complaint, did the complaint have a verification? A verification is typically a separate page following the complaint which states how the person signing it is involved in the case, that the person signing it has knowledge of the case&nbsp;and has read the complaint, and that the&nbsp;information in the complaint is true. This statement is then signed under penalty of perjury.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Most debt collection cases do not have a verification, so it is okay if you do not find one. In consumer debt cases you will typically find another page signed under penalty of perjury stating the reason the case is filed in the county it is. This is a declaration of venue and is not a verification.</p>

        <p class="jcc-lead">Review the complaint and locate each "cause of action." A cause of action is a legal theory the plaintiff is suing under. Common causes of action include:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Breach of contract</strong>: Alleging there was a written or oral contract (agreement) that you and the other side entered, and an allegation that you somehow broke the agreement resulting in damages.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Common counts</strong>: A number of common allegations typically alleging that money or goods were loaned or exchanged with a promise to pay them back. Sometimes individually described as:</p>
        
        <ul>
        	<li><strong>An open book account</strong>: alleging that the plaintiff keeps a ledger of transactions with you, and that there is a balance due</li>
        	<li><strong>Account stated</strong>: alleging that the plaintiff sent you a statement and it wasn't disputed</li>
        	<li><strong>Goods or services exchanged:&nbsp;</strong>alleging a good or service was given in exchange for a promise of payment</li>
        	<li><strong>Money loaned</strong>: alleging that money was loaned to you or another person at your request, with the promise of repayment.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Fraud</strong>: An allegation that you misrepresented something, that misrepresentation was relied upon, and the defendant was harmed as a result of this misrepresentation. This is rare in consumer debt cases.</p>

        <p>Thinking about the student loan alleged in the complaint try to remember the last time you made a payment on the loan. If you did not make a payment on the debt try to remember the date the first payment was due. Are there more than four years between that date and the date that the plaintiff filed the lawsuit?</p>
