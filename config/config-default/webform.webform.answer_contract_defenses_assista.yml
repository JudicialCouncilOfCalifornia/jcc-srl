        <p>This online app will&nbsp;ask&nbsp;a series of questions that will help identify common defenses to your lawsuit. It will generate a list of those defenses that can be copied onto your&nbsp;<em>Answer- Contract</em>, or printed out and used as an attachment to your answer.</p>

        <p>Reading through the complaint, you should find one or more "causes of action" identified. In a debt collection case you may find "breach of contract," "common counts," or occasionally "fraud" alleged. Common counts are sometimes described as several different theories, such as "open book account for money due," or "account stated,' or in several different ways which describe money being&nbsp;promised for goods or services, or money loaned out. Please identify the causes of action alleged in your complaint.</p>

        <p><strong>Warning:</strong>&nbsp;You have checked "other" above. In debt collection cases, it is very rare that theories other than breach of contract, common counts, or fraud are alleged. One exception to this is where possession of collateral is alleged. If that is the case, you should check the documents you received for an&nbsp;<em>Application for Writ of Possession&nbsp;</em>(form CD-100), and&nbsp;<em>Notice of Application for Writ of Possession and Hearing&nbsp;</em>(form CD-110). If you have received this document you must also respond separately to them, or the court may award possession of the property claimed as collateral to the plaintiff.</p>

        <p>Based on your response, you may have a defense called running of the statute of limitations. If you can prove to the court that the plaintiff waited more than four years from the last activity on the account before filing the lawsuit, or the date of the breach of the contract, you have a complete defense to the lawsuit. Even if you prove the plaintiff missed this deadline by a single day, the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover anything.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>In addition, even if you cannot prove more than four years have passed, you may be able to prove a defense called laches. To prove laches you would need to be able to prove that the plaintiff delayed an unreasonable amount of time in filing the lawsuit, and that your ability to defend the case was substantially harmed by the delay.</p>

        <p>Based on your response, you may have a defense called running of the statute of limitations. If you can prove to the court that the plaintiff waited more than four years from the last activity on the account or the date of the breach of a contract&nbsp;before filing the lawsuit, you have a&nbsp;complete defense to the lawsuit. Even if you prove the plaintiff missed this deadline by a single day, the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover anything.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>In addition, even if you cannot prove more than four years have passed, you may be able to prove a defense called laches. To prove laches you would need to be able to prove that the plaintiff delayed an unreasonable amount of time in filing the lawsuit and that your ability to defend the case was substantially harmed by the delay.</p>

        <p>If the plaintiff forgot to allege something necessary in the complaint, that is a defense called "failure to state a cause of action." This is a relatively weak defense because the plaintiff may overcome it by filing an amended complaint. Each item that you selected "No" to above, is something the plaintiff failed to include in the complaint.</p>
